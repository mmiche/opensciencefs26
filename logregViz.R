# Conclusion:
# In the predictors gender, inh_inj, and flame, the
# outcome is present more often in the class 1 than
# in class 0, e.g., 16.6% in gender class 1 versus
# 14.3% in gender class 0. This is displayed in the
# positive regression weights.
# race is the exception, where the outcome is present
# more often in race class 0 (16.3%) than in class 1
# (13.4%), displayed as negative regression weight.
# --------------------------------------

# Another side note, but important enough to address it,
# is to fully display which outcome it is which is the
# focus of the logistic regression model. For this purpose,
# I use a simulated dataset with 15 rows, binary outcome
# and a continuous predictor. The meaning of the outcome
# and predictor is irrelevant, i.e., only the technical
# detail of which outcome is modelled, is relevant.
